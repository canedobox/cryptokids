# CryptoKids Dapp

CryptoKids is an innovative and interactive decentralised application (Dapp) designed to provide a safe, fun, and exciting platform where children can learn about blockchain technology and its real-world applications, such as digital transactions, digital assets, and decentralization.

By completing tasks and challenges assigned by a parent, such as household chores and educational activities, children can earn tokens (CK) that can be exchanged for rewards in a virtual marketplace. This gamified experience encourages children to actively participate, learn, and apply their knowledge in a practical setting.

CryptoKids aims to demystify complex concepts of blockchain technology and inspire the next generation of crypto enthusiasts and innovators while promoting financial literacy, curiosity for learning, problem-solving skills and critical thinking.
